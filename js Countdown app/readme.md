**🚀 JavaScript Countdown App – A Dynamic Time Management Tool**

I’m excited to share my latest project: a Countdown Timer App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This interactive app helps users track time remaining for important events, deadlines, or special occasions with a sleek and responsive UI.

**Key Features:**

✅ User-Friendly Interface – Set custom countdowns with date/time picker

✅ Real-Time Updates – Live countdown with days, hours, minutes, and seconds

✅ Dynamic Completion Alert – Visual celebration when the timer hits zero

✅ Local Storage Support – Save and retrieve countdowns even after page refresh

✅ Fully Responsive – Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile

**Tech Stack:**
🔹 Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Event Listeners)

🔹 Styling: CSS3 (Flexbox, Animations, Responsive Design)

🔹 Persistence: Browser’s localStorage API

This project strengthened my understanding of date/time handling in JavaScript, asynchronous updates with setInterval, and clean UI/UX implementation.
