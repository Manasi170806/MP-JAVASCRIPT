**🦠  COVID-19 State-wise Tracker 🦠**

Welcome to the  **COVID-19 State-wise Tracker !** This project is dedicated to collecting, visualizing, and sharing reliable data and resources about the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) – a global pandemic that changed the world 🌍.

**🔍 What is COVID-19?**

COVID-19, short for Coronavirus Disease 2019, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was first identified in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and rapidly spread across the globe, leading to widespread health crises, lockdowns, and economic disruptions.

This virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets, and symptoms can range from mild (like cough or fever) to severe (like pneumonia or acute respiratory distress). Some individuals may remain asymptomatic but can still transmit the virus to others.
